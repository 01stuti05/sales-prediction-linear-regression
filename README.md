Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict product Sales using advertising data.
The dataset includes three marketing channels — TV, Radio, and Newspaper — and uses Linear Regression to estimate how these features influence sales performance.

📁 Project Overview

Uses the Advertising.csv dataset

Predicts Sales as the target variable

Features used: TV, Radio, Newspaper

Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization

🧠 Machine Learning Approach

Cleaned and prepared data using pandas

Performed train-test split (80% train, 20% test)

Trained a Linear Regression model

Evaluated performance using:

R² Score

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Used 5-Fold Cross-Validation for reliability

Visualized predictions with:

Scatter plot (Actual vs Predicted)

Line plot comparison
